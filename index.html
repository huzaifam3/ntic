				NTIC was founded in 1998 by a group of Nigerian and Turkish educators who shared 
				a common vision of providing high-quality education to students in Nigeria.
				With the goal of promoting academic excellence, character development, 
				and innovation, the founders set out to create a school that 
				would meet the needs of a rapidly changing world. Over the years, 
				NTIC has grown to become one of the leading schools in Nigeria, 
				with campuses in Abuja, Kano, Kaduna, Ogun, and Yobe. 
				Today, NTIC is recognized for its commitment to academic excellence, 
				its innovative approach to education, and its focus on character development. 
				With a diverse student body and a dedicated team of educators,
				NTIC continues to prepare students for success in the 21st century and beyond.
